V2.1 Change Log
*Added element:PRTN, protons. Energy particle, combines with ELEC and NEUT to form HYGN and NBLE, turns water into ACID, turns metal into SALT and HYGN, duplicates DEUT on contact with it.
*Added element:POSI, positrons. Energy particle, behaves like ELEC but combines with ELEC to form PSNM.
*Added element:PSNM, positronium. Energy particle, unstable particle formed through the combination of ELEC and POSI. Decays into a burst of particles rapidly. Hidden.
*ELEC and NEUT no longer reacts.
*ONC can turn PHOT passing through it into PRTN.
*Fusions releases PRTNs.

V2.0 Change Log
*Updated to the latest 87.2 version.
*All hidden elements shown in the "Cracker!" menu.
*Added element: VIRS, virus. Liquid, turns almost everything into itself. Burns. Becomes dust when too hot. Freezes when too cold.
*Added element: MSNS, movement sensor. Powder, creates sparks when its speed bigger than its temperature in celsius.
*Added element: ONC, octanitrocubane. Solid, extremely powerful explosive, can only be ignited by sparks and the flame of itself.
*Added element: PTCL, powered temperature controller. Solid, changes its Kelvin temperature to its tmp when activated. Conducts heat quickly.
*Added element: FLRN, fluorine gas. Gas, burns almost everything with super-hot plasma.
*Added element: C2H2, ethyne. Gas, burns with max temperature. Turns into ONC at low temperature and high pressure.
*Added element: RADN, radon. Gas, decays into electrons. Decays faster when hot.
*Added element: HBMB, heat bomb. Powder, sticks to the first object it touches then heats up particles around.
*Added element: ADMN, adamantium. Solid, indestructable metal.
*Added element: DOOR. Solid,allows particles when activated.
